### Python exercises, my learning journey!

Welcome to my repository of Python exercises! Here you will find a comprehensive collection of all the exercises I have completed since the beginning of my programming course in Python. This repository not only showcases my progress in the language but also reflects my growth as a programmer over time.

## About the Repository

In this repository, you will discover a series of exercises ordered from lower to higher complexity, designed to tackle various concepts and challenges in Python. Each exercise folder contains a detailed description of the problem to solve, as well as a solution I have crafted to address that specific challenge.

## Folder Organization

The repository is structured to allow you to follow along with my learning journey. Exercises are organized chronologically, meaning that the earliest exercises are those I tackled at the beginning of my course, and as you progress through the repository, exercises become more challenging, covering more advanced concepts.


## Contributions and Feedback

Feel free to explore, clone, and contribute to this repository. If you have ideas to improve the solutions, add additional exercises, or provide feedback, I would be glad to hear your suggestions. Together, we can make this repository even more valuable for Python learners.

Enjoy exploring my Python learning journey and happy coding!
